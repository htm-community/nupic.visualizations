# NuPIC Visualizations

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/nupic-community/nupic.visualizations](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/nupic-community/nupic.visualizations?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Work with NuPIC results interactively in a [nice web UI](https://nupic-visualizations.firebaseapp.com/). This app is designed to consume and render CSV files output by NuPIC, but it can read any CSV file with numerical data that represent some time-series.

## Requirements

* The first line in the CSV must be a header, containing the names of the fields. 
* If there is, a field labeled `timestamp` is used for x-axis/time. 

> * The data in the `timestamp` field can be either a number or a string in date-time format. To ensure that the app can parse the date, it is recommended that your timestamps conform to one of the following formats:
 - ISO 8601: `yyyy-mm-dd[T[hh[:mm[:ss[:ms]]]]]`
 - `yyyy-mm-dd [hh[:mm[:ss[:ms]]]]` (Like ISO 8601, but with a space separator for time instead of "T")
 - `mm/dd/yyyy [hh[:mm[:ss[:ms]]]]`

* Any modern browser with JavaScript
* Your favorite web server for running locally

## Launch

### Online

To try this app instantly, head to the online version at [https://nupic-visualizations.firebaseapp.com/](https://nupic-visualizations.firebaseapp.com/) <br/>
You can use [an OPF file as an example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nupic-community/nupic.visualizations/master/examples/OPF/DefaultTask.TemporalAnomaly.predictionLog.csv).

### Locally 

Or you can run locally, without a need for internet connection. 

First, get a copy of this repo, you can download a `ZIP` from Github, or clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/nupic-community/nupic.visualizations
```

Then go the the `build/` directory:

```
cd nupic.visualizations/build/
```

If you have Python installed, you can launch a simple Web server with:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

There are demo files in `examples/` for NuPIC OPF, NAB and generic CSV files. 

## Usage

 * Select a local file by clicking 'Browse...', this will start rendering a new graph. 
  * You may get warning/error labels, that can be closed.
  * You can also enter a URL of a remote file for streaming (in supported by the server). 
 * To zoom in on the graph, click and drag with the cursor. To zoom out, double-click. To pan on a zoomed graph, hold the ALT key (on Linux, hold the SHIFT key), while dragging the cursor.
 * The options to the right of the graph allow the user to:
  - Set the visibility of certain series
  - View the current value of a series, based on where the cursor is over the graph
  - Normalize any series to a selected reference series. For example, perhaps you want to compare your 'my_data' field to your 'anomaly_score' field, but your 'my_data' series varies between 100 and 10,000 - while your 'anomaly_score' field varies between 0 and 1. With the default settings, your anomaly score variations will be too small to be visible. By clicking on 'Data' for the 'my_data', and then checking the 'Normalize' checkbox for 'anomaly_score', the 'anomaly_score' will be scaled up to a ratio matching that of the 'my_data' field.

## Features

The goals of this project are:
* nice, convenient & easy to use interactive graph visualizations
* seamlessly runs everywhere (in web-browser, or [cloud](https://nupic-visualizations.firebaseapp.com/))
* plot as much as possible - generic CSV (local or remote files)
 * tries to parse timestamp/x-data from many formats
 * no restrictions on the header format
 * can plot even non-standart data - strings (planned)
* NuPIC specific OPF-file plotting
 * extra work done to parse the OPF and extract the suitable fields
* graph interaction:
 * show/hide, higlight a series, get current value under cursor
 * range select to zoom in/out the graph, pan
 * quickly export shown subsection of graph as a PNG image or CSV data (planned)
 * manually annotate selected section with text data (planned)
* specific functionality for anomaly detection
 * auto-highlight series over/under a threshold (or other condition)
 * rescaling some series to be easily visible with the reference series
 * with annotated anomalies, compute precision, recall, F-measure (planned)
* works with quite large data (million poitns) 
 * support for real-time streaming data sources (planned)

## Develop

If you are interested in developing, or modifying the code, follow these instructions:

* Install `node(js) >= 0.10.25` and `npm`. This will vary depending on your OS. <br/>
> On Ubuntu LTS you need to use newer packages, follow [the nodejs guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

* From the root directory of this project, `npm install`. This will install all of the package dependencies.
* Make your modifications.
* When you are ready to perform a build, run `gulp`. This will build the app in the `build` directory. Launch the app as described in the "Launch" section, above.

### Deploy

The `build/` directory contains all the static files needed to deploy this application. You can use any static file hosting service. For example, here are instructions for deploying to [firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.html). You can see this sample application deployed at <https://nupic-visualizations.firebaseapp.com/> via Firebase.
